# NOAA Dashboard - Web Scraping and Dashboard Project

A Python program that retrieves **historical daily weather data** from the [NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/daily-summaries) website and display the results in an interactive dashboard.

The project involves Selenium for web scraping, data cleaning, transforming the data into a structured format, storing it in a SQLite database, querying it via command line, and presenting it using Dash with interactive visualizations.
